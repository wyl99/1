### Questions
##### P9
a. Δ = L/R = 850,000 bits / 15Mbps = 0.0567 sec

Δ/(1−Δβ) = 0.0567 sec / (1 - 0.0567 sec &times; 16 requests/sec) = 0.60 sec

the total average response time = 0.6 sec + 3 sec = 3.6 sec

b. now Δ/(1−Δβ) =  0.0567 sec / (1 - 0.4 &times; 0.0567 sec &times; 16 requests/sec) = 0.089 sec

the total average response time = 0.4 &times; (0.089 sec + 3 sec) = 1.24 sec

##### P28
a. The TCPServer won't receive the message. Because TCPserver must be running as a process before TCPclient attempts to initiate contact, then it can receive the message.

b. The UDPServer won't receive the message either. To receive and reply the message, the UDPServer must be running as a process before the client sends its message.

c. They can't connect to each other. Because TCP needs a connection but UDP doesn't.

##### P30
Yes.

Advantage: One can get message from the server more rapidly.

Disadvantage: One will occupy many resources of the web server and other clients will be hard to connect to the server.
